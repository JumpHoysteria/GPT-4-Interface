To monitor the endogenous expression of YAP during in vitro EHT, we engineered a construct into the 3' terminus of the YAP locus utilizing the human ES cell line H9 as a framework. This genetic modification was accomplished through the employment of electroporation and CRISPR/Cas9-assisted genomic engineering, specifically, homology-directed repair. Following a G418-selection process, clone isolation, excision of the selection cassette (TAT-Cre), and single-cell deposition, we undertook a comprehensive validation using quantitative Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR), Western Blot, Flow Cytometry, and Immuno-fluorescence. The results led us to conclude that mCherry serves as a reliable YAP reporter. Subsequently, we demonstrated that endothelial cells exhibit a robust expression of mCherry (Fig 2a, b). Moreover, we observed a decline in mCherry expression correlating with the progression of EHT in our haematopoietic differentiation cultures (Fig. 2c, d).
